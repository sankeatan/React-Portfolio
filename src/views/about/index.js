			<h2 className="ps-3 me-5 mb-5">| About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a full stack web developer passionate about creating technologies
					that facilitate community organization and education. I recently graduated 
					from a certificate program hosted by the University of Central Florida. In 
					this program I learned the MERN stack, as well as how to use Agile
					development methods to quickly and cooperatively produce code.

					The last decade of my resume is mostly in Education. I've 
					taught an age range of Kindergarten to College. Along with
					working internationally for many years, this professional 
					background gives me a unique perspective and effective communication
					style that would be useful for any team. Breaking down complex ideas, 
					finding solutions for difficult technical and relational issues, and
					finding value for the particularities that any team member or client 
					can bring to the table - these are all qualities that my professional
					history has given to me.
